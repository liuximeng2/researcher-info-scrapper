    "research_focus_description": "My primary research interest involves examining semantic memory, object recognition, and aspects of language functioning using a combination of neuropsychological testing, structural and functioning neuroimaging, and electrocorticography. I am also investigating the use of selective laser amygdalohippocampotomy as a safer alternative to standard open resections for the control of seizures. Secondary interests include exploring the impact of antiepileptic drugs (including in utero exposure), acute seizure activity.",
